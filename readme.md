# AutoCar

This is a project that I made at montco that I unfortunately never documented. I am writing this 5 years after the fact and I do not remember most of how this worked.

The project used a RPI 3 as the client and a PC as the server. The client was connected to a custom RC car whose motion was controlled by the PI. The client would send a cleaned up video feed to the server and the server could send move commands to the PI. The idea was to train the car to drive autonomously, but we never made it that far.
